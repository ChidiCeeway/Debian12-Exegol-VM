- **Docker-based**: Simplifies the installation and management of pentesting tools.
- **User-friendly**: Easy to set up and use, even for beginners.
- **Versatile**: Suitable for CTFs, bug bounty, OSINT, and other offensive security tasks.

## Installation

To get started, you need to download the VM image. Visit the [Releases section](https://github.com/ChidiCeeway/Debian12-Exegol-VM/releases) to find the latest version. Download the file and follow these steps:

1. **Install VirtualBox**: If you haven‚Äôt installed VirtualBox yet, download it from the [official website](https://www.virtualbox.org/) and install it on your system.

2. **Import the VM**:
   - Open VirtualBox.
   - Click on "Import Appliance."
   - Select the downloaded VM image file.
   - Follow the prompts to complete the import.

3. **Start the VM**: Once imported, you can start the VM by selecting it in VirtualBox and clicking "Start."

4. **Initial Setup**: Log in using the default credentials provided in the documentation.

## Usage

Once the VM is up and running, you can start using Exegol for your pentesting needs. Here are some basic commands to get you started:

- **Start Exegol**: Open a terminal in the VM and run:
  ```bash
  exegol
  ```

- **List Available Tools**: To see all the tools available in Exegol, use:
